                                                alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but

                                                with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (<span className="font-semibold">“Arbitration Rules”</span>) governing the arbitration are

                                                single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten

                                                option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten

                                                Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United

                                                reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
